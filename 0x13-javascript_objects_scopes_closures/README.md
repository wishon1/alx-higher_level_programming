## Concepts Covered

### 1. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Principles
   - **Class Creation**: Illustrates the creation of a `Rectangle` class to model rectangle objects.
   - **Encapsulation**: Demonstrates encapsulation by defining methods within the `Rectangle` class to manipulate its properties.

### 2. JavaScript Functionalities
   - **Module Import**: Shows how to import a module using `require()` in Node.js.
   - **Class Instantiation**: Explains the process of creating instances of a class using the `new` keyword.
   - **Method Invocation**: Demonstrates invoking methods to perform specific actions on objects.

### 3. Basic Geometric Operations
   - **Printing Dimensions**: Displays the width and height of the rectangle.
   - **Doubling Size**: Doubles the dimensions of the rectangle, effectively scaling it.
   - **Rotation**: Swaps the width and height of the rectangle, simulating a rotation operation.

### Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:
- Why JavaScript programming is amazing
- How to create an object in JavaScript
- What `this` means
- What `undefined` means
- Why the variable type and scope is important
- What is a closure
- What is a prototype
- How to inherit an object from another

### Copyright - Plagiarism
- You are tasked to come up with solutions for the tasks below yourself to meet with the above learning objectives.
- You will not be able to meet the objectives of this or any following project by copying and pasting someone else’s work.

- Any form of plagiarism is strictly forbidden and will result in removal from the program.

### Requirements
#### General
- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All your files will be interpreted on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using node (version 14.x)
- All your files should end with a new line
- The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/node`
- A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
- Your code should be semistandard compliant. Rules of Standard + semicolons on top. Also as reference: AirBnB style
- All your files must be executable
- The length of your files will be tested using `wc`
- You are not allowed to use `var`
