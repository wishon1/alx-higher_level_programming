# ALX Higher Level Programming - Python Import Modules

This repository contains projects and tasks related to Python import modules. Below are details of each task:

## 0x02. Python - Import & Modules

### Description
This project covers various concepts related to importing modules and using functions from other files in Python.

### Learning Objectives
- Importing functions from another file
- Creating modules
- Using command line arguments with Python programs

### Requirements
- Python 3.8.x
- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All files interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- All files end with a newline
- First line of all files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- Use of `pycodestyle` (version 2.8.*) for code styling
- All files must be executable

### Files
1. **0-add.py**: Program that imports the function `add(a, b)` from the file `add_0.py` and prints the result of the addition.
2. **1-calculation.py**: Program that imports functions from the file `calculator_1.py` and performs mathematical operations.
3. **2-args.py**: Program that prints the number and list of its arguments.
4. **3-infinite_add.py**: Program that prints the result of the addition of all arguments.
5. **4-hidden_discovery.py**: Program that prints all the names defined by the compiled module `hidden_4.pyc`.
6. **5-variable_load.py**: Program that imports the variable `a` from the file `variable_load_5.py` and prints its value.
7. **100-my_calculator.py**: Program that imports all functions from the file `calculator_1.py` and handles basic operations.
8. **101-easy_print.py**: Program that prints `#pythoniscool`.
9. **102-magic_calculation.py**: Python function `magic_calculation(a, b)` that behaves like the given Python bytecode.
10. **103-fast_alphabet.py**: Program that prints the alphabet in uppercase.
