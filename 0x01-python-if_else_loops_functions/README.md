# ALX Higher Level Programming - Python

## Project: 0x01. Python - if/else, loops, functions

## Overview
This project covers basic Python concepts including if/else statements, loops, functions, and more. It aims to reinforce fundamental programming skills while introducing students to Python syntax and conventions.

## Project Description
The Python - if/else, loops, functions project is part of the ALX Higher Level Programming curriculum and serves as a foundational exercise in Python programming. Students will explore essential concepts such as control flow structures, function implementation, and syntax conventions in Python. Through a series of tasks, learners will practice writing Python scripts that demonstrate proficiency in utilizing if/else statements, loops, functions, and basic arithmetic operations. The project aims to provide students with a solid understanding of Python programming fundamentals, preparing them for more advanced topics in software development.

### Specific learning objective
The learning objectives cover understanding why Python is great, mastering indentation, using if and if...else statements well, being skilled with comments, variables, and loops, distinguishing Python's for loop from C's, using break, continue, and else in loops, grasping the pass statement, using range, functions, and return statements effectively, understanding variable scope and traceback, and applying arithmetic operators well.

## Requirements
### Python Scripts
Python scripts must adhere to specific requirements: editable with `vi`, `vim`, or `emacs`; compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS with Python version 3.8.5; ending with a new line; starting with `#!/usr/bin/python3`; containing a mandatory README.md file; following `pycodestyle` (v2.8.\*) for code style; being executable; and undergoing code length testing with `wc`.

### C Scripts
C scripts should be editable with `vi`, `vim`, or `emacs`, compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `gcc` with specific options, ending with a new line, containing prototypes of all functions in `lists.h`, including guarded header files, and pushing the header file, with lists being optional.
