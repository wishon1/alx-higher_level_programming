# ALX Higher Level Programming - Python Data Structures

## Overview
This repository contains solutions to various tasks related to Python data structures, specifically lists and tuples. The project covers topics such as list manipulation, tuple operations, and basic algorithms.

## Resources
- **Read or Watch:**
  - [3.1.3. Lists](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/introduction.html#lists)
  - [Data structures (until 5.3. Tuples and Sequences included)](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html)
  - [Learn to Program 6 : Lists](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1HUzrvS-Pw)

## Learning Objectives
The learning objectives of this project include understanding the advantages of Python programming, mastering the usage of lists and their methods, discerning the distinctions and resemblances between strings and lists, implementing lists as stacks and queues, utilizing list comprehensions, grasping tuples and their usage, determining when to use tuples versus lists, defining a sequence, comprehending tuple packing and sequence unpacking, and utilizing the `del` statement effectively.

## Requirements
### Python Scripts
Python scripts for this project must be edited using vi, vim, or emacs, compiled using Python 3.8.5 on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS, follow the PEP 8 code style guidelines using pycodestyle version 2.8.*, be executable, and include a mandatory README.md file at the project folder's root.

### C
The requirements for Python scripts in this project include using specific editors (vi, vim, emacs), using Python 3.8.5 on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS, adhering to the Betty style for code formatting, avoiding global variables, limiting functions to no more than 5 per file, ensuring all function prototypes are included in a header file named lists.h, and using header file guards to prevent multiple inclusions.

## Tasks
The project consists of multiple tasks, each focusing on specific operations with Python data structures such as lists and tuples.

1. Print a list of integers
2. Secure access to an element in a list
3. Replace element in a list
4. Print a list of integers in reverse
5. Replace in a copy
6. Remove all characters 'c' and 'C' from a string
7. Print a matrix of integers
8. Add two tuples
9. Return length of a string and its first character
10. Find the maximum integer in a list
11. Find multiples of 2 in a list
12. Delete an item at a specific position in a list
13. Switch values of two variables

Each task has specific requirements regarding input, output, and implementation.
