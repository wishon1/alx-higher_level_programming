# 0x04. Python - More Data Structures: Set, Dictionary

## Overview
This repository contains solutions to various tasks related to more advanced data structures in Python, specifically sets and dictionaries. The project covers topics such as set manipulation, dictionary operations, and advanced algorithms.

## Resources
- [Python Documentation: Data Structures](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html)
- [Advanced Python - Lambda, Filter, Reduce, Map](https://python-course.eu/advanced-python/lambda-filter-reduce-map.php)
- [YouTube Video: Python Sets and Dictionaries](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GAC6KQUPeg)

## Requirements
- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- Interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using Python3 (version 3.8.5)
- All files end with a new line
- The first line of all files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- Mandatory README.md file at the root of the project folder
- Code should adhere to PEP 8 style guidelines
- All files must be executable
- Length of files will be tested using `wc`

## Tasks
1. **Squared Simple:** Compute the square value of all integers in a matrix.
2. **Search and Replace:** Replace all occurrences of an element in a list with another element.
3. **Unique Addition:** Add all unique integers in a list, considering each integer only once.
4. **Present in Both:** Find the common elements between two sets.
5. **Only Differents:** Find the elements present in only one of two sets.
6. **Number of Keys:** Count the number of keys in a dictionary.
7. **Print Sorted Dictionary:** Print a dictionary sorted by its keys in alphabetical order.
8. **Update Dictionary:** Replace or add key/value pairs in a dictionary.
9. **Simple Delete by Key:** Delete a key from a dictionary.
10. **Multiply by 2:** Create a new dictionary with all values multiplied by 2.
11. **Best Score:** Return the key with the highest integer value in a dictionary.
12. **Multiply by Using Map:** Multiply each value in a list by a specified number using map.
13. **Roman to Integer:** Convert a Roman numeral to an integer.

Each task requires implementing a specific function with defined prototypes and constraints.

## Conclusion
The Python More Data Structures project provides a comprehensive exploration of advanced data structures in Python, enhancing participants' understanding of sets, dictionaries, and their applications.
